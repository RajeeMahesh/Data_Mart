Data Mart is Dannyâ€™s latest venture and after running international operations for his online supermarket that specialises in fresh produce - I am helping him to analyse his sales performance.

In June 2020 - large scale supply changes were made at Data Mart. All Data Mart products now use sustainable packaging methods in every single step from the farm all the way to the customer.

My Analysis will answer these questions, 
1.What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
2.Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?
3.What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?
